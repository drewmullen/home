Linking Containers

src:
must still expose in DF but not in runtime (-p)

rcvr:
have to link to src

ex of rcvr:
docker run --name=<receiver name> --link=<source container>:<alias - nick name> -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

src providers rcvr with many env variables:
<ALIAS_info>
/etc/hosts <-- <alias IP> <alias name>
