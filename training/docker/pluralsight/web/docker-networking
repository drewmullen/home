Pillars of Docker Networking
CNM - container network model
libnetwork
drivers

CNM - 'theory and design'
sandbox - "namespace", contains full network stack
endpoint - network interface; eg: eth0
network -

libnetwork - the actual code of the CNM
'control plane'

Drivers
'data plane'
"local" drivers = native to docker
"remote" drivers = 3rd party




_______ basic /old ________
#docker0 bridge

see bridge connected devices
yum install bridge-utils (windows? mac?)

brctl show docker0

/var/lib/docker/containers/<container>/hosts & resolv.conf

hosts file is overlayed by new files

docker port <container>

-P to assign random high # ports (must expose in Dockerfile)

Linking Containers

src:
must still expose in DF but not in runtime (-p)

rcvr:
have to link to src

ex of rcvr:
docker run --name=<receiver name> --link=<source container>:<alias - nick name> -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

src providers rcvr with many env variables:
<ALIAS_info>
/etc/hosts <-- <alias IP> <alias name>
