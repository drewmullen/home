docker machine: provisions docker hosts / engines
docker compose: compose multi-container apps
docker swarm: schedule containers over multiple docker engines

Tutum - pretty UI

# stop & remove all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

containers stop when they have no running services

How containers are built and work:
isolated bin / libs
isolated process tree (PIDs)

kernel Namespaces:
- user namespace
- mnt namespace
- net namespace
- pid namespace

Control Groups (cgroups):
groups resources and apply limits
- tweak cgroup limits to changes resources

Capabilities:
breaks root privs down to specific privs
CAP_CHOWN
CAP_KILL
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

libcontainer is the replacement for LXC (managed by docker)
